# LoanInterests.java
Develop a Java application that will help the bank calculate the simple and compound interests
Banking Application
The Mpumalanga provincial government is trying to establish an investment bank called Mpumalanga 
Investor Banking for loaning capital to young entrepreneurs who wants capital to grow their start-up
business. The banks wants to calculate the interest earned on their investments using the simple interest 
of 15% and a compound interest of 10% .
The bank has hired your company to calculate the interest earned on their investments on loans in simple 
interest and compound interest.
Formulas
SIMPLE INTEREST is interest paid only on the original amount of the principal at each 
specified interval (such as annually). 
I = Prt, 
where I = Interest, P = Principal (money at the start), r = interest rate, and t = time. 
COMPOUND INTEREST is interest paid on both the original principal and the interest earned previously. 
A = P(1 + r)^t
, 
where A = total amount including previous interest earned, P = principal, r = interest rate, and t = 
time.

The program must do the following:
1.1 Declare all constants and necessary variables.
1.2 Prompt the user to enter the following :  
o Principal amount,
o Loan period in years
o Compounding frequency per annum
Validate the input data from user input to check if it is suitable for calculating interest yielded.
1.2.1 Initial principal amount is nonzero and nonnegative.
1.2.2 Loan period in years is non-negative and less than 20 years.
1.3 Calculate the simple interest loan yielded amount using the formula above.
1.3.1 Check to validate that the interest yielded is greater than zero.
1.4 Calculate the compound interest yielded amount using the formula above.
1.4.1 Validate the loan frequency, the loan frequency must be between 1 and 12 months in a year.
1.4.2 Validate the interest yielded, the interest yielded must be a value greater than zero
1.5 Display the loan input data and the loan yield amounts as indicated in Figure 1.5
1.6 Determine which option provides the best interest rate between simple and compound interest.
